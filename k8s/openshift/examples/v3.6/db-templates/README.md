OpenShift 3 Database Examples
=============================

This directory contains example JSON templates to deploy databases in OpenShift
on OpenEBS volumes. They can be used to immediately instantiate a database and
expose it as a service in the current project, or to add a template that can be
later used from the Web Console or the CLI.

The examples can also be tweaked to create new templates.


## Usage

### Instantiating a new database service

Use these instructions if you want to quickly deploy a new database service in
your current project. Instantiate a new database service with this command:

    $ oc new-app /path/to/template.json

Replace `/path/to/template.json` with an appropriate path, that can be either a
local path or an URL. Example:

    $ oc new-app https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openebs/openebs/master/k8s/openshift/examples/db-templates/openebs-mongodb-persistent-template.json

The parameters listed in the output above can be tweaked by specifying values in
the command line with the `-p` option:

    $ oc new-app examples/db-templates/openebs-mongodb-persistent-template.json -p DATABASE_SERVICE_NAME=mydb -p MONGODB_USER=default -p STORAGE_CLASS_NAME=openebs-default

### Deleting a new database service

Use these instructions when you need to completely delete the app and persistent
volumes in your current project. Separately delete your database service and
persistentvolumeclaim using the commands below:

    $ oc delete all -l app=openebs-mongodb-persistent

Use "oc get pvc" command to find your persistentvolumeclaim name:

    $ oc get pvc

Delete the pvc using the correct name from the output of above command:

    $ oc delete pvc mongodb
    $ oc delete secret mongodb
