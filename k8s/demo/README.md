OpenEBS can be deployed in dedicated or hyper-converged mode with Kubernetes. There are several ways in which Kubernetes Cluster can be setup - Checkout [Kubernetes - Getting Started Guides](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/). We have tested with the following deployment options.

## Google Container Engine

You can enable OpenEBS on your existing container cluster or a new cluster created on Google Cloud Platform using the following guides:

## Vagrant

To get started, all you need to have is an Ubuntu Host or VM with minimum RAM (8GB Free) and CPU (8 Cores Free). If you are running within VM, it needs to have VT enabled. Follow through the instructions given in the below links:
